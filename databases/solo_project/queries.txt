RELEASE 2

1- Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
select * from doctors;

2- Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
update doctors set age=53 where name="John Miller";

3- Display the information in both tables using one query.
SELECT * FROM doctors, countries WHERE doctors.country_id = countries.id;

SELECT doctors.name,doctors.age,  countries.name FROM doctors JOIN countries ON doctors.country_id = countries.id;

delete from doctors where nobel="true";
